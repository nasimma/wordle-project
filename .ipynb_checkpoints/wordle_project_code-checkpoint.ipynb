    "## How does Wordle game works?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Wordle, you have six attempts to guess a secret five-letter word. After each guess, youâ€™ll get feedback about which letters are correctly placed, which are misplaced, and which are wrong. \n",
    "\n",
    "After you make a guess, each letter is categorized. Correct letters are marked in green, misplaced letters are marked in yellow, and wrong letters are marked in gray.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you make any mistakes, like guessing a word with six letters, then the game will give you appropriate feedback and let you take another guess.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "## Our Challenges for this project\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll employ Python for our implementation, utilizing SQLite as the database. Upon reviewing the game's code, the overall design appears relatively straightforward. However, a key challenge lies in restricting a player to one game per day, requiring a daily change in the word to be played. Concurrently, users should have access to game statistics. This functionality will also be developed in Python, with SQLite serving as the database, and the database file will be created within the Python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In our database, we manage three distinct tables: 'GAMES', 'WORDS', and 'USERS'. The 'WORDS' table originally contains imported data from a related database. To validate my code, I incorporated a set of words for testing purposes. Upon the initiation of a game and the creation of a user, the user's details will be promptly stored in the 'USERS' table within the database. As gameplay progresses, entries will be added to the 'GAMES' table. Simultaneously, the 'USERS' and 'WORDS' tables will undergo updates based on whether the played word is recognized or unfamiliar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Word Table\n",
    "The 'WORDS' table is structured to store word-related data within the database. It comprises columns for 'id', which serves as a unique identifier, and 'word', designed to hold text data representing individual words. Additionally, the table includes 'game_count' and 'success_count' columns, both set as non-null integers. 'game_count' tracks the total number of times the word has been involved in a game, initialized with a default value of 0. Meanwhile, 'success_count' records the number of successful instances associated with the word, also starting at a default value of 0. This table is created or verified upon execution, ensuring it exists within the database structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GAMES Table\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'GAMES' table is intended to manage game-related information within the database. It consists of columns such as 'id' serving as a primary key for unique identification, 'date' for storing textual date information denoting when the game occurred. Additionally, the 'word_id' and 'user_id' columns are present, both set as non-null integers, aimed at referencing specific entries in the 'WORDS' and 'USERS' tables respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### USERS\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'USERS' table is pivotal for managing user-related data in the database, featuring columns such as 'id' as the primary key for unique identification. The 'username' field is uniquely constrained, ensuring distinct usernames across users. Essential user information like 'name', 'surname', and 'birthday' is stored in non-null text fields. Additionally, columns like 'played_games', 'games_won', and 'daily_plays' are integers set as non-null, tracking the total games played, games won, and daily play counts respectively. An alteration is performed on the table, introducing the 'last_play_date' column to record the date of the user's most recent gameplay activity, further enhancing the scope of user activity tracking within the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step by Step coding game\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important part of doing a project is planning and for doing this project, firstly we should have a prototype, to address all the errors, implementing all the steps and getting feedbacks to resolving them. Throgh this phase, we want to do these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Plan Gussing the word**\n",
    "\n",
    "1-1- In this step, we should create a complete list of words which their lenght is 5 character\n",
    "\n",
    "1-2- then we should select a word from this list randomly as a desired word\n",
    "\n",
    "1-3- simultaneously, we should create list of alphabet letters for asking user to choose from them\n",
    "\n",
    "1-4- We should ask from user to enter a 5-character word and it should be valid\n",
    "\n",
    "1-5- We should define a definition which helps us to check selected word by user is in our words_list or not, if this word is not in our initial list (step1), we should show an alarm to user, this is meaningless word and should write a meaningful word\n",
    "\n",
    "1-6- We should check out, the place of each character, for doing that we should write a code to compare the place and each character of user selected word by each character and the place of desired word. Then, we should check that if  our desired-word characters includes any of characters of user_selected word and this is in the same position of desired-word character, set this word as green and Set as yellow if the character exists but in different position and else we should show this character by black. This is important, to show these character's colour in our alphbet list.\n",
    "it could be a little challenging). \n",
    "\n",
    "1-7- In each step, we should check that if all the positions and all the characters are the same as desired word, we should finish the game and if they are not the same as desired word we should continue the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "1-8- Then, we do 4-7 previous steps 6 times. So, if user could not find the word, we should show him/her you lose and if she/he can find the word we should show him/her \"congratulation\" and user win. \n",
    "1-9- We should define a variable as \"success_game\" to count the number of successful attemps. So, we should consider an initial value for that equal 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Creating user account**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Another part of our project is creating a profile for each user. This profile should comprise all the necessary information of each user and also in this part we want to calcuate the probability of win for each user. So, for creating this profile w should do these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "2-1- Firstly we should create some boxes for users to Sign up their unique user name.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-2- Then we should check that this username exists or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-3- If we don't have this username, we should create a new profile for our user. For instance, our user  should input user's name, user's birthday, and we should consider two variables which their initial values are 0, like the number of game played and the rate of win. \n",
    "\n",
    "2-4- If the username is repetetive, user should sign in on the game and we should add 1 to the number of games played.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-5- In this step, we should calculate the win rate by deviding the number of successful game to the number of games.\n",
    "\n",
    "for doing these steps we define several functions and I want to explain them as follow as below:\n",
    " \n",
    "* signup_process(username):\n",
    "\n",
    "Collects user information (name, family name, birthday) and creates a new user profile in the 'USERS' table upon successful validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* has_user_played_today(user_id):\n",
    "\n",
    "Checks if a user has already played the game on the current day based on their 'last_play_date' in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ask_for_username():\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompts the user for a username and either retrieves an existing user's profile or initiates the signup process if the username is new.\n",
    "\n",
    "* validate_birthday_format(birthday):\n",
    "\n",
    "Validates the format of the inputted birthday (YYYY-MM-DD) using regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* select_random_word():\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieves a random word with a length of 5 characters from the 'WORDS' table in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "* validate_user_input(word):\n",
    "\n",
    "Validates the user's input for a 5-letter word, checking its format and existence in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "* insert_word(word):\n",
    "\n",
    "Inserts a word into the 'WORDS' table in the database.\n",

    "\n",
    "* play_game(user_id):\n",
    "\n",
    "Executes the gameplay functionality, prompting the user to guess a 5-letter word and handling game outcomes and database updates accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* check_the_day():\n",
    "\n",
    "Checks the current day's gameplay statistics and executes the main gameplay loop (main()) if no games have been played.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Calculates the success rate (games won / total games played) for a specific user.\n",
    "\n",
